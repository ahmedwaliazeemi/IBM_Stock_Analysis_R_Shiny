üìä IBM Stock Analysis and Market Risk Visualizer (R/Shiny)

üéØ Project Overview

This project provides a financial time series analysis of IBM stock data (2022-2024) using R. The core deliverable is an interactive Shiny web application that visualizes complex market cause-and-effect relationships using a network diagram.

The goal is to clearly show the chain reaction:
Missed Earnings ‚û°Ô∏è Investor Panic ‚û°Ô∏è Stock Drop ‚û°Ô∏è Strategic Pivot/Layoffs

‚ú® Key Features

Time Series Plot: Cleanly plots IBM's adjusted stock price over time (2022-2024) for trend identification using the quantmod and ggplot2 packages.

Interactive Network: A dynamic network diagram demonstrating causal linkages between financial and business factors using the shiny and visNetwork packages.

Financial Modeling: Focuses on modeling how external pressures translate into internal corporate action.

üöÄ How to Run the App Locally

To test the interactive Shiny app, you will need R and RStudio installed.

Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/ahmedwaliazeemi/IBM_Stock_Analysis_R_Shiny.git](https://github.com/ahmedwaliazeemi/IBM_Stock_Analysis_R_Shiny.git)
cd IBM_Stock_Analysis_R_Shiny



Install Packages: Run this command in your R console:

install.packages(c("quantmod", "ggplot2", "visNetwork", "shiny"))



Execute the Script: Open the IBM data.R file in RStudio and click the "Run App" button, or run the entire script. The time series plot will generate, and the interactive network visualizer will launch in your browser.
